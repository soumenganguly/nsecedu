        <p align="justify">Mechanical Engineering is an engineering discipline that involves the application of principles of Physics for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. Mechanical engineers use the principles of mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics and energy in the design and analysis of automobiles, aircraft, heating and cooling systems, manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, medical devices and more.</p> 
                                 <p align="justify">Mechanical engineering is one of the core engineering branches on which the pillars of all small/large industry stands. So, a mechanical engineer can get jobs in the Maintenance, Designing, Operational, R&D and Management departments of an industry. After Graduation or Post-Graduation completion, candidates are likely to be recruited in Automobile Industry, Cement Industry, Steel Industry, Power industry, Manufacturing plants, Drilling Industry and Mining Industry.
